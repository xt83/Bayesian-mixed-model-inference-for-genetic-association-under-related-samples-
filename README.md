The current folder contains the code file ‘BNME_real_data.R’ for real data analysis implementing the BNME approach introduced in “Bayesian mixed model inference for genetic association under related samples with brain network phenotype”.

We propose a Bayesian network-response mixed-effect model that considers a network-variate phenotype and incorporates population structures. Considering the intricate topological nature of genetic influences on the phenotype, our model captures the effect components via a set of effect subnetworks and impose an inter-network sparsity and intra-network shrinkage to dissect the phenotypic network configurations affected by the risk genetic variant. We have developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm tailored for efficient posterior analysis and applied it to the Human Connectome Project - Young Adult data with 149 pairs of genetically-confirmed monozygotic twins, 94 pairs of genetically-confirmed dizygotic twins and their non-twin siblings.
